## Ingredients
- [ ] 2.5 cups all-purpose flour
- [ ] 2 tsp. ground cinnamon
- [ ] 2 tsp. kosher salt
- [ ] 1 tsp. baking powder
- [ ] 0.5 tsp. baking soda
- [ ] 0.5 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
- [ ] 0.125 tsp. ground cloves
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 15 oz. pumpkin puree
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. + 1 tsp. grated ginger
- [ ] 1.5 cups sugar
- [ ] 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 0.5 cup raw pumpkin seeds

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 325. Lightly grease a 9x5 loaf pan and line with parchment.
2. Whisk flour, cinnamon, kosher salt, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and cloves in a medium bowl.
3. Whisk eggs, pumpkin purée, ginger, and 1½ cups sugar in a large bowl. Stream in oil, whisking constantly until mixture is homogeneous.
4. Gently fold half of dry ingredients into egg mixture until no dry spots remain. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients, stirring to combine but being careful not to overmix.
5. Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top with a spatula. Scatter pumpkin seeds over batter, pressing lightly to adhere. Sprinkle seeds with an extra 1 Tbsp. sugar.
6. Bake bread, rotating pan once halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 80–90 minutes.

## Notes
- Hit top with torch to carmelize the sugar if you have the time
