## Ingredients
### Tangzhong
- [ ] 43g water
- [ ] 43g whole milk
- [ ] 14g bread flour
### Dough
- [ ] 300g bread flour
- [ ] 11g dry milk
- [ ] 50g sugar
- [ ] 6g salt
- [ ] 1 packet instant dry yeast
- [ ] 113g whole milk
- [ ] 1 large egg
- [ ] 57g melted butter

## Steps
1. To make the tangzhong combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.
2. Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to room temperature.
4. To make the dough combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead until a smooth, elastic dough forms.
5. Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
6. Divide dough into four pieces. Take a piece, roll it out flat, then fold it into thirds. Roll this into a long retangle, then  roll it onto itself seam side in. Place all four seam side down in a lightly greased 9 x 5 loaf pan, cover loosely, and proof for 45 minutes.
7. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Brush the loaf with milk or egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and bake for 28 to 32 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle roll should read at least 190F.
8. Remove the loaf from the oven. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.

## Notes
- Makes great toast!
