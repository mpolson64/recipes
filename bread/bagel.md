## Ingredients
- [ ] 9 oz. ice water
- [ ] 2 tbsp. malt syrup
- [ ] 14.67 oz. bread flour
- [ ] 4 tsp. vital wheat gluten
- [ ] 2 tsp. instant yeast
- [ ] 1.25 oz. cornmeal
- [ ] 1.75 oz. sugar
- [ ] 1 tbsp. baking soda

## Steps
1. In a food processor add bread flour, vital wheat gluten, and instant yeast. Pulse to combine.
2. Next combine cold water and malt syrup in a bowl. Whisk to mix. Turn food processor on low and add the cold water and malt syrup mixture. Mix for about 20 seconds, stop, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it has rested for 10 minutes, add salt. Turn the food processor on medium to high for about 90 seconds.
3. Remove dough from food processor and knead for about a minute. Next, divide dough into 3.5 ounce pieces. Roll the pieces into tight balls and cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.
4. Roll out a piece of dough with a rolling pin until it’s roughly 5 inches across. Next, start from one end of the circle and start rolling the dough onto itself. Once it is rolled into a tight roll that is 9-10 inches long, it’s time to twist the dough. Place one hand on each side of the dough roll and then roll the ends in opposite directions to create the “twist”. Wrap the dough around your hand and then pinch the ends together. With the ring of dough still wrapped around your hand, roll the dough on your work surface to seal together.
5. Place the bagels on a baking sheet covered in cornmeal. Cover that with plastic wrap and let sit for an hour. Once they’ve sat for an hour, place them in the fridge overnight or for 24 hours. 
6. Bring water in a pot to a boil and add sugar and baking soda. Add the bagels to the water and boil for about 20 seconds on each side.
7. Remove and place them on a wire rimmed baking sheet, making sure the cornmeal side is down. If you’d like to add toppings, now is the time to do it.
8. Add 0.5 cup of boiling water to the bottom of the pan and then place in the oven at 450F for 20 - 25 minutes flipping them halfway through.
