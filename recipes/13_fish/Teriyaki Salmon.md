## Ingredients
- 600g salmon fillets, scaled and pinboned
* 1 tbsp cornflour or potato starch
* 2 tsp vegetable oil
* 1/2 â€“ 3/4 cup [[Teriyaki Sauce]]
* 2 tsp grated ginger
* 1 spring onion, finely sliced

## Preparation
1. Cut the salmon fillets lengthways into smaller 2cm wide fillets and with a pastry brush, dust the salmon on all sides with the cornflour.
2. Heat a frying pan over high heat until very hot. Add the oil and reduce the heat to medium, Add the salmon fillets (in batches if necessary) and fry for about 2-3 minutes per side until the salmon is just barely cooked through. Remove the salmon from the pan.
3. Blot most of the oil from the pan with a piece of kitchen paper, then add the teriyaki sauce to the pan and squeeze in the juice from the ginger. Bring the sauce to a simmer and simmer for about 2 minutes until the sauce thickens and becomes glossy. Add the salmon back into the pan, turn it once and then spoon the thickened sauce over the fillets for just a minute. Remove the salmon to a serving plate and scatter with the spring onion.

## Notes
* For a less oily variant, cook salmon in broiler very close to the heating element. Slice the salmon more thinly so it will not need to be flipped.
