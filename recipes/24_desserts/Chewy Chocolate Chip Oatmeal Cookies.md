## Ingredients
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 2 eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups AP flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 cups quick-cooking oats
- 1 cup chopped walnuts 
- 1 cup chocolate chips

## Preparation
1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.
3. Cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, until well combined; stir in vanilla extract.
4. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just blended. Mix in quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop batter by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes
* To prevent spreading increase flour to 1 1/2 cups and chill dough 30 minutes before baking
