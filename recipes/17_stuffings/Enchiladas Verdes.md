## Ingredients
- 4 chicken thighs
- 1 large white onion
- White wine (optional)
- 1 tsp Cumin
- 1tsp Coriander
- 1tsp Paprika
- Salt
- Pepper
- 2 cups [[Salsa Verde]]
- 8 oz grated Oaxaca cheese

## Preparation
1. Fry the chicken thighs in oil until browned, and remove.
2. Roughly chop the onion and fry it in the same pot until golden.
3. Put in maybe a teaspoon (or more) each of the ground cumin, coriander and paprika, grind in some pepper, and fry the spices for a minute.
4. Put the chicken back in, and cover with about half white wine, half water. Mix in a pinch of salt. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the chicken is just starting to fall apart, maybe a half hour.
5. Take the chicken out and chop it up into small chunks. Boil the braising liquid down to a thick glaze. Mix the chicken into the glaze along with 1 cup of salsa and 2 oz of cheese.
6. Grease up a 7x11 inch baking dish. Dunk a tortilla into the salsa, then bring it to the baking dish. Scoop in a modest line of filling, and roll up the tortilla, seam-side down. Repeat until you've filled your baking dish and/or exhausted your filling. Spoon the rest of the salsa on top of the enchiladas, and sprinkle on the rest of the cheese. Bake uncovered until the cheese is browned to your liking, maybe 20 minutes.
