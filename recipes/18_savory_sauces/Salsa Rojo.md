## Ingredients
- 2oz dried guajillo peppers
- 2oz dried ancho peppers
- 2-6 pequin, chiltepin, or arbol chiles, depending on your spice tolerance

## Preparation
1. 1. Remove the stems from each pepper and shake or scrape the seeds out.
2. Toast the deseeded peppers over medium-high heat for 60-90 seconds until fragrant
3. Soak peppers in boiling water for 10-15 minutes
4. Place softened peppers in a blender with other optional aromatics* (*This is where the sauce gets personal and potentially freaky. I add charred onion, garlic, cumin, and Mexican oregano, but you could take it much further with ingredients like epazote, cinnamon, chocolate, fish sauce, gochujang...)
5. Blend peppers with chile-infused water until nappe consistency is achieved 6. Strain through a fine mesh
## Notes
* Makes about 2 cups depending on how much water is added
* Mix in equal parts with [[Salsa Verde]] for a non-traditional but very good condiment for chips
