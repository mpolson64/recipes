## Ingredients
- 2medium garlic cloves, smashed with the side of a knife
- 1 small shallot, roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons shoyu or tamari
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons red or white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon light miso paste
- 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup grapeseed, vegetable or canola oil
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons toasted white or black sesame seeds

## Preparation
1. Combine garlic, shallot, shoyu, vinegars, miso and sugar in a blender and blend on high speed until homogenous. (Alternatively, mash garlic and shallots in the bowl of a large granite or marble mortar and pestle into a fine paste using the pestle, then stir in the shoyu, vinegars, miso and sugar.)
2. With the blender running on medium speed (the liquid should form a vortex but not jump up and splatter on the walls of the blender), slowly drizzle in the grapeseed oil. (If using a mortar and pestle, slowly drizzle in the oil as you stir vigorously with the pestle.)
3. Transfer to a lidded jar. Stir in the sesame oil and sesame seeds with a spoon. Dressing can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Shake well before using.

## Notes
* Can be made without a blender by grating garlic and shallot on a microplane and box grater respectively
