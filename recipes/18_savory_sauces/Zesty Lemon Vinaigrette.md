## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) fresh lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest, from 1 medium lemon
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dijon mustard
* 1 1/2 teaspoons honey
* 1 medium clove garlic, grated (about 1/2 teaspoon)
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot (3/4 ounce; 21 g), from 1 medium shallot
* 1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume
* 1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil

## Preparation
1. In a large nonreactive bowl, whisk together lemon juice, lemon zest, mustard, honey, garlic, shallot, and salt. Slowly stream in olive oil, whisking vigorously and constantly, until emulsified and creamy. Alternately, place all ingredients in a jar, seal tightly, and shake until emulsified. If not serving immediately, pour into a small nonreactive container or jar; cover and refrigerate for up to 1 month.

## Notes
* The vinaigrette can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 month. Whisk or, if storing in a jar, shake well before use.
