## Ingredients
- 1 Lb (450g) trimmed green beans
- 2 Tbsp (30g) white miso
- 2 Tbsp (16g) toasted sesame seeds
- 1 Tbsp (15g) lemon juice
- 3 Tbsp (42g) neutral oil, like canola, grapeseed, etc

## Preparation
1. Bring a pot of water almost to a boil. Add some salt and get the water to a rolling boil. Dump in the green beans. If they want to poke out of the water, tuck them in and cover the pot. Set the timer for 2 minutes. After the first minute you should get your boil back. As soon as that happens, take off the lid so that the water doesnâ€™t boil over.
2. Immediately drain them and rinse in cold water for a couple of minutes until they are completely cold. Dump the green beans onto a towel and dry very well, then move to a large bowl.
3. Puree the miso, sesame seeds, lemon juice, and oil with a machine of your choice. The amounts I give will work with an immersion blender, but for the regular blender or food processor you might need to double the recipe. The leftover sauce can be refrigerated for a week and is great on many vegetables.
4. Coat the green beans with the sauce. Taste and adjust for salt and acidity.

## Notes
* You can also serve the sauce as a dip instead of coating the vegetables in it.
* It's possible to prepare this without a blender by substituting the sesame seeds for tahini, and whisking the miso, tahini, and lemon juice together then very slowly emulsifying in the oil as if it were a vinaigrette
