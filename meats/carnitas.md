## Ingredients
- [ ] 3 lbs. pork shoulder
- [ ] 1 lb. pork belly
- [ ] 1 cup chicken stock
- [ ] 1 tbsp. kosher salt
- [ ] 1 tsp. fresh ground black pepper

## Steps
1. Cube all pork into 1 in. cubes.
2. Place all ingredients in a large heavy pot and bring to a boil over medium-low heat.
3. Simmer for 2 hours, or until pork shreds easily, then uncover for 10 minutes to boil off some (but not all) liquid.
4. Transfer (in batches if necessary) pork and pan juices to a large skillet. Cook over high heat until liquid evaporates and pork begins to fry in its rendered fat. Fry until crispy, 10 - 15 minutes.

## Notes
- Replace 2 hours of initial cook with 35 minutes at high pressure in an pressure cooker
