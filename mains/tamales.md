## Ingredients
- [ ] 560g masa harina
- [ ] 700ml hot water
- [ ] 375g lard
- [ ] 1.5 tsp. baking powder
- [ ] 1 cup chicken stock
- [ ] Filling of choice
- [ ] Corn husks

## Steps
1. Begin by soaking the corn husks in room temperature water for at least 3 hours.
2. In a bowl combine 560g of masa harina with 700ml of hot water. Give a good mix with a wooden spoon until a crumbly dough forms. Set aside and let it rest for 15 minutes.
3. In a stand mixer, whip 375g of lard for 2 minutes until itâ€™s light and fluffy. Add 1.5 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of kosher salt. Mix to combine.
4. Slowly add soaked masa harina while scraping down the sides.
5. While mixing stream in warm chicken stock.
6. Let dough rest in the fridge for at least one hour.
7. Take your corn husk, open it up, and spread your tamale dough in a relatively thin and even layer over the top half of the corn husk leaving a 2 inch border on each side. Stuff with your fillings, and roll together so that the two sides of the tamale dough meet in the middle. Fold up the tapered end of the corn husk, and with 2 small strips of corn husks, tie together in the center. Repeat for however many tamales you would like to make.
8. Place all the tamales standing up in the steam basket of a large pot. Cover the top of the tamales with some corn husks to help concentrate the steam in the steamer. Add about 2 cups of water, and cook for about 45 minutes.
9. Once you remove the tamales from the pot, let them rest for 30 minutes.

## Notes
- Potential fillings include poblano, white onion, and Oaxaca cheese; carnitas; chipotle shredded chicken
- Instead of steaming, pressure cook for 15 minutes and allow steam to naturally release
- Substitute shortening and vegetable broth for lard and chicken stock respectively for vegan variant
