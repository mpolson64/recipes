## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 2–3 lb. rotisserie chicken
- [ ] 2 medium yellow onions
- [ ] 1 lb. turnips
- [ ] 6 cloves garlic
- [ ] 1 tbsp. thyme leaves
- [ ] 3 tbsp. butter
- [ ] 2.5 tsp. kosher salt
- [ ] 1.5 tsp. fresh ground black pepper
- [ ] 3 tbsp. all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1 cup dry white wine
- [ ] 2 cups heavy cream
- [ ] 10 oz. frozen peas
- [ ] 1 sheet puff pastry

## Steps
1. Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400F. Remove and discard skin of rotisserie chicken, then shred meat into 1" pieces (you should have 4–5 cups meat); set aside.
2. Dice onions and garlic, and roughly chop turnips.
3. Melt butter in 12" cast iron skillet over medium heat and sweat onions for 5 - 6 minutes.
4. Add turnips, garlic, and thyme, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes.
5. Add flour and stir, cooking until raw flour flavor is gone.
6. Deglaze with wine.
7. Add 1 cup cream, chicken, and peas. Cook down until cream has thickened. Adjust for seasoning now.
8. Roll out puff pastry to right size then drape over pan, trimming the excess.
9. Brush remaining cream over top and cut vents.
10. Place in oven and cook for 22 - 24 minutes, or until top is golden brown.
11. Reduce heat to 350F and good for another 25 - 35 minutes, or until gravy is thick and bubbling over the sides of the skillet.
12. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

## Notes
- Replace turnips with carrots for a more traditional flavor profile
- Substitute chicken broth for white wine for deeper chicken flavor
