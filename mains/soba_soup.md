## Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb. large peeled, deveined shrimp
- [ ] 1 sheet kombu (about 1 oz.)
- [ ] 1 small bunch mustard greens, kale, mature spinach, or Swiss chard (about 8 oz.)
- [ ] 10 scallions
- [ ] 1 1 in. piece fresh ginger
- [ ] Kosher salt
- [ ] 1 oz. bonito flakes
- [ ] 0.25 cup mirin
- [ ] 5 Tbsp. soy sauce
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. sesame oil
- [ ] 4 large eggs
- [ ] 8 oz. soba noodles
- [ ] 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds

## Steps
1. Soak 1 sheet kombu in 8 cups water in a large Dutch oven until soft and flexible, 15–20 minutes.
2. Remove leaves from greens and coarsely chop.
3. Thinly slice scallions.
4. After kombu has soaked, turn heat to medium. Once you see small bubbles around the edges, use tongs to remove kombu. Avoid bringing the water to a boil.
5. Add bonito flakes, bring to a boil, and remove from heat. Allow to steep for 2 minutes then strain through mesh sieve.
6. Wipe out Dutch oven and return to medium heat. Add chopped greens, remaining two-thirds of scallions, and 0.5 tsp. salt. Using a microplane, grate in ginger. Pour in 0.25 cup water and stir to combine. Cover and cook until greens are wilted, 4 – 5 minutes.
7. Add dashi, mirin, soy sauce, and sesame oil and bring to a gentle simmer.
8. Bring salted water to a boil and soft-boil eggs (6.5 minutes).
9. Remove and peel eggs, and in the same pot cook soba noodles for 4 minutes, then drain and rinse with cold water. Divide noodles among shallow bowls.
10. Pinch tails off shrimp; season with salt. Add to pot and remove from heat. The shrimp will turn bright pink in the residual heat of the broth.
11. Divide broth among bowls with noodles. Slice eggs in half as you add to bowls. Drizzle yolks with sesame oil and soy sauce. Sprinkle with reserved scallions and sesame seeds.

## Notes
- Strain the dashi a second time through a coffee filter for clearer broth
- Try swapping out soba noodles with udon
